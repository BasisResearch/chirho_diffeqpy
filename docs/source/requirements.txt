# FIXME chirho version is listed in three places:
#  1. here in the requirements.txt
#  2. in the main readme (in instructions for installing with ability to run tests)
#  3. in the .github/workflows/test.yml file that basically implements the instructions in the readme
# So change in all three for now. This will go away if we can automate the version-pinned test-capable installation
#  in a way that pulls from this requirements.txt file.
